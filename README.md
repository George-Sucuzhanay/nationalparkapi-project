# US National Park Search Web App

## 🚀 Project Objective:
### Let visitors search from a list of activities to do at different National Parks
1. Visitors can click an activity and have the web app display all the National Parks tied to a specific activity
2. After selecting a specific park, the app should pull up an informational page so the visitor can learn more about the park.
### Have a feature on the web app where visitors can: 
1. Retrieve data from park web cams based on which National Park(s) the user selects. Specifically, this feature should be able to display the non-streaming images collected from park web cams so a visitor can view them with ease.
